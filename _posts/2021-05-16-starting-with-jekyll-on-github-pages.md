# Thinking about a blog

- no one click option on gh, felt it could be a rocky road
- site,js => selfhosted, tls etc,
- gh edit file in browser online okay => will write more about browser-only setup
- local jekyll necessary to generate => needs ruby, bundler both can go wrong
- local jekyll serving did not work (wrong ruby version?)
- template repo idea
- tried setting/changing config keys
- gh pages and actions down
- config weird => preset baseurl option fucks with gh/jekyll
- template works => caveat: updates to github-pages gem could require updating locally

# TODO
- flesh out bullet points, add relevant sources (gh and jekyll docs, status page, stackoverflow)
- read about jekyll drafts
